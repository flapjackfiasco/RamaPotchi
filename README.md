# RamaPotchi
 Digital Pet

## Hello!
This is a project I started with my kids, for fun. It's based on the following project:
    
[Picotamachibi - website](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/picotamachibi.html)

[Picotamachibi - Github](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/picotamachibi)

## Changes
The idea is to make a smaller hardware platform than the Pi Pico used in the original, using the same RP2040 mcu, and adding some missing essentials.
Here are some of the additions that are implemented/planned/considered:

- [x] Rechargable battery (implemented).
- [x] Battery charging status LEDs (implemented).
- [x] A Game Status RGB LED (hardware: implemented / software: planned).
- [ ] A speaker/buzzer (planned).
- [ ] A haptic feedback motor (considered).
- [ ] Environment sensors (considered).

## Progress
